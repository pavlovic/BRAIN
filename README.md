# BRAIN
Brain Regression Analysis In Networks

The main goal of this toolbox is to provide software to analyse brain networks using Stochastic Block Models (SBMs). Currently, only a command line version of the multi-subject SBMs proposed by Pavlovic et al. (OHBM 2018) is available. Additional features will be added to it (e.g., use of Firth's regression instead of traditional Maximum likilihood regression, a better input parser,...). Other SBMs will also be added in the future. Finally, we will also provide R and Matlab wrappers for use in these software packages.
